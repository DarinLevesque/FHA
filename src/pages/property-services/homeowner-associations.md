### Fair Housing Property Pro: For Homeowners’ Associations

As an HOA board member or property manager, do you really know YOUR fair housing rights?
How are HOAs expected to know everything NEW about fair housing law, and manage the property?
Fair Housing Advocates, Inc. recently dedicated its expertise to designing a comprehensive fair housing training & consulting package made solely for landlords and property managers of rental and homeowners communities: The Fair Housing Property Pro.
Fair Housing Property Pro seeks to empower homeowners associations [HOAs], condominiums, apartment communities, mobile home parks, and their staff by protecting their fair housing rights. We provide exclusive knowledge about the fair housing complaint process only available from our insiders, so properties can avoid expensive fair housing discrimination claims long before they arise.

#### Who Are We?

We are fair housing experts, not hired attorneys coming to your defense after-the-fact.
FHA’s experts filed several hundred fair housing complaints against properties like yours for violating the Fair Housing Act.
FHA’s complaints against these properties are selected by HUD for investigation. With near perfect success, our fair housing complaint strategy yields a settlement agreement for our clients resulting in millions of damages for the properties to absorb.
As a result of our experience defending consumers’ rights, we have become experts in the fair housing complaint process. We understand the complete fair housing investigation cycle from complaint inception, submission through investigation, negotiations, and settlement.
We can help you understand precisely how to protect your property.
We can help you establish & protect your fair housing rights.

####What Can Fair Housing Advocates Do for My Property?
In 2018, FHA is putting all that knowledge and expertise to work for housing providers: HOAs, apartment complexes, condominiums, mobile home parks, and property management firms.
We've designed a cost-effective program that will educate and train staff, mitigate risk, and ultimately help protect their business long before any fair housing issues become a huge financial problem.
We provide the staff real-time access to our experts, while we work behind-the-scenes to identify, mitigate, and even eliminate high risk fair housing related problems.
Our FHA experts know how to work with an Association’ legal counsel to formulate affirmative defense strategies during any fair housing disputes.

#### Why Do You Need Fair Housing Advocates?

###### We know fair housing.

Because we have successfully filed hundreds of fair housing complaints against housing providers just like you, across the country, compelling settlements resulting in millions of dollars of damages.

###### We know the formula.

Because our fair housing IQ produces iron clad discrimination complaints HUD is motivated to investigate.

###### We know the process.

Because of our experience, we know the complete fair housing complaint process better than any organization offering conventional real estate management services.

###### We know the secrets.

Because we have worked with investigators all over the country, we have usable intelligence not typically shared with the public about the fair housing investigation process.

###### We know your fair housing rights.

Because our job was to know the property’s rights and anticipate their defenses in all of our successful cases.

## Fair Housing Property Pro: For Homeowners’ Associations

#### I. Fair Housing Onboarding

This first step is necessary for FHA to uncover any fair housing related issues in the property’s documents, or in their policies and procedures. Once FHA has identified the HOA’s weaknesses, we can then suggest the customized training, and design deliverables to have the greatest positive impact.

FHA approaches this Onboarding review process from the perspective of an experienced Fair Housing Advocate- “Would the HOA’s written rules, regulations, and policies provide an advocate enough reason to investigate the HOA, test the property, and file a fair housing complaint for a consumer alleging housing discrimination?”

Suggested revisions to any such rules, regulations, policies or procedures could be provided, and approved by FHA’s own in-house legal counsel, to be approved by the HOA’s counsel and/or board members.

##### 1. Rules, Regulations, and Policies Review:

FHA will intake electronic copies of the association’s Rules & Regulations to identify any potentially discriminatory rules or practices. The following documents are most relevant during the intake process:

* Pool & Clubhouse Rules
* Pool Use Agreement
* Fitness Center Rules
* Community Rules & Regulations
* Community Bylaws & Covenants
* Pet & Companion Animal Policy
* Resident Policy/Renter’s Policy
* Architectural Restrictions
* New Resident Information

#### 2. Applicant & Resident Forms Review

FHA will review any forms the association might require their applicants and residents to complete during the housing application process- this may include forms which would grant use of the amenities, common areas, as well as pet registration.

* Resident Application
* Resident Authorization Form
* Pet Agreement
* Pet Addendum
* Club House Reservation/Rental

#### 3. Reasonable Accommodations & Modifications Process Review:

    The purpose of this service is to review and critique an already existing accommodation or modification review process flow. ‘Process flow’ could include documents but should really show how the staff and residents interact together during the interactive dialogue process to make appropriate fair housing related decisions. Documents would more likely be reviewed during the “Applicant & Resident Forms Review.”

FHA can evaluate your existing written Reasonable Accommodations, and Reasonable Modifications review process if one is already in place. The evaluation will identify any concerns or violations already part of your process, and provide constructive feedback to mitigate, or even eliminate the risk.

Once an acceptable review process is in place, your association would be eligible to participate in our “ESA Letter” analysis service.

If your association does not have a formal accommodation or modification review process in place, FHA can develop one as a separate deliverable.

##### Documents reviewed could include:

* Request for Reasonable Modification/Accommodation Verification Form
* Authorization for Release of Information
* Reasonable Accommodation Agreement
  FHA recommends any suggested changes in policy be reviewed and approved by the property’s legal counsel and/or board members.

#### 4. Posted Rules Review

Many allegations of housing discrimination start with rules posted upon a placard at the HOA’s amenities and common areas. In some cases, the posted rules can differ from those printed in the official Rules & Regulations manual for the community causing confusion within the community’s staff and with the residents.

FHA would review any posted rules to uncover any unnecessary risk, and to promote message uniformity between the posted rules, and the published rules-in-fact. FHA would be interested in receiving pictures of any of the following:

* Picture of posted Pool Rules
* Picture of posted Fitness Center rules
* Picture of Club House Rules

### II. Core Services Package

The following eight services would be provided to our HOA clients after they have completed the fair housing onboarding process. The services would typically be provided over the life of a one-year agreement.

####1. Specialized Fair Housing Training & Education:
#####An FHA Flagship Fair Housing Service

Our training modules are born from the hundreds of complaints FHA filed and negotiated on behalf of our consumer clients who alleged housing discrimination on the basis of their protected class.

None of our training modules provide generic information like those from most national training organizations.

FHA’s training modules are designed to provide housing providers with immediate actionable information and advice. All of our training is conducted Live and is conveniently hosted via webinar, so FHA can address questions as they are presented. An attendee would only need:

* Internet connection [for video]
* Phone [for audio]

FHA training webinars could also feature special guest speakers from the fair housing, legal, and medical community. Only FHA’s clients are invited to attend our training modules and would have access to a recorded copy online.

Currently Available Fair Housing Training Modules:

1.  Reasonable Accommodations & Modifications for HOAs
2.  Emotional Support Animals [ESAs]- Fake or Real?

7.  Advanced Understanding of the Fair Housing Complaint Process
8.  RE Agents & Fair Housing Obligations
9.  Race, Color, and National Origin Discrimination
10. Housing Discrimination & College Housing Obligations

Our Fair Housing Education modules are designed to be less formal and are built to provide broad knowledge to a less sophisticated audience on a general fair housing subject.

Currently Available Fair Housing Education Modules:

1.  Fair Housing Education for New Hires, Maintenance Staff, and Board Members
2.  What is a Reasonable Accommodation?
3.  Protected Class Discrimination & The Federal Fair Housing Act

FHA may invite special guest speakers from the fair housing, legal, civil rights, and medical community as well as other subject matter experts

FHA hosts at least one Fair Housing Training webinar and one Fair Housing Education webinar each month, by invitation only.

\*This service is also offered for purchase separately. Contact FHA at info@fairhousingact.org to make arrangements.

#### 2. Fair Housing Testing:

##### An FHA Flagship Fair Housing Service

Testing is a very important enforcement tool approved by HUD, and it is a very effective means of gathering evidence when FHA files a fair housing complaint on behalf of a consumer. Our testing evidence is always critical to compelling a settlement.
FHA can conduct testing upon your property and staff which most closely follows that recommended by HUD for fair housing organizations.

FHA would conduct such testing only as an educational tool, not an enforcement tool, to uncover any potentially violative fair housing behavior. Our findings will serve to provide the property with actionable feedback, so the property can make adjustments accordingly.

This ‘real world’ testing of your staff is critical to understanding how Fair Housing training and education is actually being implemented where it counts.

A tester results report outlining any compliance concerns or violations can be provided at the conclusion of the testing investigation.

#### Testing Methods:

<dl>
              <dt>a) Telephonic Testing:</dt>
              <dd>
                FHA will make contact with the association to engage the staff
                as a person seeking housing and challenge the association staff
                with a fair housing scenario- the test. Telephonic testing could
                include text messages exchanged with the association staff. An
                audio recording of the test call can be provided along with the
                tester’s report.
              </dd>
              <dt>b) Email Testing:</dt>
              <dd>
                FHA will make contact with the community to engage the staff as
                a person seeking housing and challenge the association staff
                with a fair housing scenario- the test. The test would involve
                email interactions with the association staff- this may include
                the submission of completed forms, and documents.
              </dd>
              <dt>c) Website Initiated Testing:</dt>
              <dd>
                Some associations have online forms on their websites. FHA will
                engage the association as a person seeking housing and challenge
                the association staff with a fair housing scenario- the test.
                The test will be initiated via the online form but may continue
                via telephone or email.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <h5>Types of Testing:</h5>
            <dl>
              <dt>a) Service Skills:</dt>
              <dd>
                FHA would engage in a dialogue to measure both Fair Housing
                knowledge, as well as the staff member’s customer service
                skills, and ability to engage in the “interactive dialogue
                process,” a key component to the reasonable accommodation review
                process.
              </dd>
              <dt>b) Disability Testing:</dt>
              <dd>
                Most disability testing would not require a comparative since
                most discrimination is by treatment, or direct application of a
                discriminatory rule
                <ul>
                  <li>i. Reasonable Accommodation request</li>
                  <li>ii. Reasonable Modification request</li>
                </ul>
              </dd>
              <dt>c) Familial Status Testing:</dt>
              <dd>
                Most Familial Status testing would not require a comparative
                since most discrimination is by treatment, or direct application
                of a discriminatory rule
              </dd>
              <dt>d) Protected Class Comparative Testing:</dt>
              <dd>
                Race, Color, National Origin, Religion, and Sex/Gender. FHA can
                design tests using the available methods listed above to uncover
                discriminatory treatment on the basis of a protected class by
                implementing comparative testing methodology.
              </dd>
              <dt>e) Staff Member Specific Testing:</dt>
              <dd>
                FHA can work with the association to identify a particular
                member of their staff as the focus of a fair housing test.
              </dd>
              <dt>f) Role Specific Testing:</dt>
              <dd>
                FHA can also customize testing methodologies to measure the fair
                housing aptitude of:
                <ul>
                  <li>Property leasing agents</li>
                  <li>Property managers</li>
                  <li>HOA Board Members </li>
                  <li>
                    P/T & F/T staff members accepting in-bound phone calls
                    regarding housing availability{" "}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    RE Agents and those immediately ‘outside’ of the property
                    staff
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </dd>
            </dl>

\*This service is also offered for purchase separately. Contact FHA at info@fairhousingact.org to make arrangements.

#### 3. ESA Letter Analysis:

##### An FHA Flagship Fair Housing Service

HOAs are getting inundated with requests to waive their pet rules to accommodate an Emotional Support Animal by a disabled applicant or resident.

HUD’s accommodation review process permits the HOA to request “reliable documentation” from the disabled person which should verify the disability, and the need for their ESA as well as the requested accommodation. The housing provider is usually given an “ESA Letter,” or some other documentation [aka “doctor’s letter”] which needs to be properly evaluated.

Each ESA Letter Analysis would consider the following elements:

* Source “reliability”
* Disability verification
* Disability-related need verification
* Accommodation Requested
* Financial & Administrative burden
* Direct threat to Health & Safety
* Risk of substantial physical damage

FHA can provide critical feedback about the “ESA Letter” so the housing provider can take next steps on their own in the interactive dialogue process as well as avoid potential fair housing pitfalls.

FHA would receive any ESA Letter via email from the housing provider; likewise, FHA would provide academic feedback based only upon the language of the ESA Letter. FHA does not provide legal advice regarding the tenant’s housing eligibility requirements. The ESA Letter Analysis focuses solely on the construction of the letter and is not meant to be a strict “pass/no-pass” for the applicant’s housing eligibility since many factors are considered by the housing provider FHA would not have access to.

\*This service is also offered for purchase separately. Contact FHA at info@fairhousingact.org to make arrangements.

#### 4. Real-Time Fair Housing Consultation:

##### An FHA Flagship Fair Housing Service

FHA is available to provide real-time consultation to its clients at a moment’s notice or by appointment. All consultations are confidential.

Should FHA be asked to provide customized fair housing advice to address a specific consumer situation which may lead to a fair housing claim or litigation, FHA would have its in-house counsel review, approve, and provide any such advice.

Most meetings fall within one of two categories: Casual, and Critical.

i. Casual: FHA is providing general fair housing education or answering questions as an extension of the fair housing training/education received.

ii. Critical: FHA is tasked to review a critical situation involving a potential, or developing, fair housing issue which might require attention to documents, interactive dialogue, and case specifics. FHA’s counsel would be in attendance.
Provided FHA can help resolve the issue during the phone conference, the meeting would fit within this deliverable. If the situation calls for additional work outside the scope of this deliverable, FHA would recommend we move the workload to our “Fair Housing Counselling” service
Most Consult meetings usually fall well within the 60-minute range.

###### Email Consultation:

FHA is also accessible via email for less time sensitive fair housing counseling and advice needs; response time is within 24 hours via email.

###### Real-Time Communications:

FHA prides itself as being the de facto real-time online fair housing organization and is considering making itself available via other online real-time communications channels: Skype [video, text, and call], and Telegram [has point-to-point encryption].

\*This service is also offered for purchase separately. Contact FHA at info@fairhousingact.org to make arrangements.

#### 5. Online Footprint Review

An HOA’s message online can be responsible for initiating a fair housing investigation, testing, or even worse- a fair housing complaint. FHA can review your association’s online footprint to uncover any fair housing related concerns. A results report outlining any concerns can be provided.

Online footprint may include:

* Association Website and all web pages
* Social Media: Facebook, Next Door [if applicable]
* Online Marketing & Advertising of Property- links provided by the association

\*Review to occur during month of annual membership anniversary.

#### 6. Board Member & Property Management Education Webinar

FHA designed a basic fair housing training webinar which provides a broad overview of the federal Fair Housing Act for new hires, HOA board members, and property management staff.

The webinar will cover housing discrimination on the basis of Race, Color, National Origin, Gender, Familial Status, and Disability. The webinar will also provide a small focus on the most common fair housing violations affecting disabled persons at HOA communities:

* Reasonable accommodations: Emotional Support Animals, and parking spaces for the disabled
* Reasonable modifications
* Familial status discrimination and rules against children
  The webinar will have a live Q&A session to handle any immediate concerns by the new hire.

The webinar will not provide state-specific fair housing training; all training is federal fair housing focused.

\*This service is also offered for purchase separately. Contact FHA at info@fairhousingact.org to make arrangements.

#### 7. Weekly Fair Housing Q&A Call

This is a live open forum telephonic conference call for clients only. This is not a recorded call and will not be accessible afterwards.

The Fair Housing Call will provide a real-time forum to address fair housing curiosities, hypotheticals, and general questions housing providers may have regarding the fair housing act. The call is an excellent opportunity to voice fair housing concerns, and pose challenging questions, which could shape future training modules.

FHA may invite special guest speakers from the fair housing, legal, civil rights, and medical community.

Anticipated call time of 60 minutes or more based upon activity.

### How Do You Get Started?
