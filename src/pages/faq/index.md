  - question: Who Can File a Fair Housing Complaint?
    answer: Literally anyone can file a complaint alleging discrimination- a person, a business, an organization, even someone associated with the victim can file a complaint if they were also harmed by the discriminatory housing practice.
  - question: When Should I File a Fair Housing Complaint?
    answer: A complainant [person alleging discrimination] should file a complaint within one year of the most recent discriminatory housing practice, at the latest. If the alleged violation occurred, for example, 366 days ago it would not be a timely violation eligible for filing. One can also file if the discrimination is currently ongoing, or is about to occur in the future.
